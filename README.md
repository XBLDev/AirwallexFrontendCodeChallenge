Airwallex - Frontend Code Challenge

Redux version of this chanllenge is done, some parts of it feel a bit weird
but it works just like the in-component-state-changing version. Finishing tests
and will upload later.

How to compile/run:

1. Git init
2. Git pull https://github.com/XBLDev/AirwallexFrontendCodeChallenge.git
3. npm install
4. Open one terminal, run: npm start
5. Open another terminal, run: npm run bundle
6. To run test, open a terminal and run: npm test

At the time of first submit(2:02, 10/11/2017), I'm currently re-making this app
with Redux to make testing easier, but I'm stuck at the last step where I 
have to do a XMLHttpRequest call in the reducer. Will upload another version
with Redux once it's finished.
